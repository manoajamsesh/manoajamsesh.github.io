<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h2>

<p>Many UH students have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.</p>

<h2>
<a id="our-solution" class="anchor" href="#our-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Solution</h2>

<p>The Manoa Jam application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.</p>

<p>You can check out our organization through this <a href="https://github.com/manoajamsesh">link</a>.</p>

<p>See the current state of the application itself <a href="https://manoajams.meteorapp.com/">here</a>!</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-landing-page" class="anchor" href="#the-landing-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Landing Page</h3>

<p>The first page that the user will see will be the landing page, which provides an introduction and quick summary for what the app is about and who the intended users should be. From there you can log in by clicking on "log in" and proceed with your UH credentials.</p>

<h3>
<a id="the-home-page" class="anchor" href="#the-home-page" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Home Page</h3>

<p>Once logged in, you can see the home page and a list of currently registered users. The intended function of the follow buttons is so that when you follow a user, you will be notified of any updates that occur to that user, such as upcoming jam sessions that they will partake in.</p>

<h3>
<a id="your-profile" class="anchor" href="#your-profile" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your Profile</h3>

<p>This is your profile page, which will contain pertinent information that will help other users contact as well as get to know you through your About Me section. The intended use of the social media links are to indicate that the users can choose to link their profiles from other sites to supplement a user's profile. Upcoming sessions are also displayed within the profile page. However, these functions are still in the works.</p>

<h3>
<a id="edit-profile" class="anchor" href="#edit-profile" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Edit Profile</h3>

<p>The edit profile page allows you to edit your profile by either uploading a picture or editing content.</p>

<h3>
<a id="browse" class="anchor" href="#browse" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Browse</h3>

<p>The browse page's intended use is similar to the home page, but differs in that the search function can allow the user to see more information about other and can filter through the list using keywords.</p>

<a id="initial-user-study" class="anchor" href="#initial-user-study" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial User Study</h2>

<p>For this initial user review, we gathered five students that were from the University of Hawaii system and had working UH accounts in order to log in and access the application.</p>

<p>The reviews mostly touched upon the user friendliness of the interface and the relative difficulty of understanding the purpose of using such an application. All reviewers recommended that a new banner image for the application be chosen as the current one is still rather bloated and detracts from the overall aesthetics of the application. However, they liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and liked having everything laid out in front of them.</p>

<p>The reviewers thought that they liked the concept and intended use of the application and approved of the ability to "follow" a user in order to keep track of musicians and make friends. They recommended that the navigation should be placed at the top and that the picture was rather distracting. They also recommended that there be a announcements page that they should land in first to see any updated content. They would also like to see a forum implemented so that others could talk and hang out online. There should also be a specific area dedicated to technical support, which could be implemented into the forum.</p>

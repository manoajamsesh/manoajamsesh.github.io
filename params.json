  "body": "# Welcome to Manoa Jam Sesh\r\n## The Problem\r\nMany UH students have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.\r\n\r\n## Our Solution\r\nThe Manoa Jam application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.\r\n\r\nYou can check out our organization through this [link](https://github.com/manoajamsesh).\r\n\r\nSee the current state of the application itself [here](https://manoajams.meteorapp.com/)!\r\n\r\n## Guided Tour\r\n\r\n## Developer Guide\r\n* Be sure that Meteor is installed on your development system.\r\n\r\n* git clone the project to a project directory with the command:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy.\r\n\r\n* Install NPM on your development machine\r\n\r\n* To run a local instance of the site on your development system, enter your project directory and run the command:\r\n\r\n    meteor â€”settings ../config/settings.development.json\r\n\r\n* Local instance can be accessed on any modern browser at localhost:3000\r\n\r\n* It may be helpful to refer to [this template](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/).\r\n\r\n## Initial User Study\r\nFor this initial user review, we gathered five students that were from the University of Hawaii system and had working UH accounts in order to log in and access the application.\r\n\r\nThe reviews mostly touched upon the user friendliness of the interface and the relative difficulty of understanding the purpose of using such an application. All reviewers recommended that a new banner image for the application be chosen as the current one is still rather bloated and detracts from the overall aesthetics of the application. However, they liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and liked having everything laid out in front of them.\r\n\r\nThe reviewers thought that they liked the concept and intended use of the application and approved of the ability to \"follow\" a user in order to keep track of musicians and make friends. They recommended that the navigation should be placed at the top and that the picture was rather distracting. They also recommended that there be a announcements page that they should land in first to see any updated content. They would also like to see a forum implemented so that others could talk and hang out online. There should also be a specific area dedicated to technical support, which could be implemented into the forum.\r\n\r\n## Current Milestones\r\n[Milestone 1](https://github.com/manoajamsesh/manoajam/projects/1)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 2](https://github.com/manoajamsesh/manoajam/projects/2)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 3](https://github.com/manoajamsesh/manoajam/projects/3)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nAzad Abdeljawad (@Azadaj)\r\n\r\nCameron Simao (@cksimao)\r\n\r\nDee Mosher (@dmosher42)\r\n\r\nKendrick Chen (@kendrickchen)\r\n\r\nPreston Exzabe (@pexzabe)\r\n\r\n## Current Pages\r\n\r\n### Home Page\r\n\r\nThe Home Page displays a list of registered users listing their various interests and skills. You will have the option to send them a private message to simply talk or plan a campus jam.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/20701116/46c01e00-b5b5-11e6-8ec4-7bea653b5593.png)\r\n\r\n### Profile Page\r\n\r\nThe Profile Page will be your own personalized hub in Campus Jam and will display a variety of information about you to help anyone viewing your profile to know more about you. A list of the user's upcoming jam sessions will also be available to see.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/20701733/afce1476-b5b8-11e6-9c42-709e6a7e3af1.png)\r\n\r\n###Browse Page\r\n\r\nThe browse page (primarily only for users rather than jam sessions as of now) will allow you to search for users based on their name or even keywords (e.g. Primary Instrument, Genre, etc.)\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/20701783/d8b527b2-b5b8-11e6-91ce-f64281ba4ad4.png)\r\n\r\n###Schedule Jam Session Page\r\n\r\nFill out a form in order to schedule a jam session by entering important imformation needed to inform others about what your session will entail to attract the appropriate viewers.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/20702993/0e27a960-b5be-11e6-8364-f674ecd6918a.png)",

Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.\r\n\r\n## Our Solution\r\nThe Manoa Jam application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.\r\n\r\nYou can check out our organization through this [link](https://github.com/manoajamsesh).\r\n\r\nSee the current state of the application itself [here](https://manoajams.meteorapp.com/)!\r\n\r\n## Guided Tour\r\n\r\n###The Landing Page\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-14 at 8 04 22 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/21213718/7040eaa2-c23a-11e6-8ace-a27f5c8eac64.png\">\r\n\r\n###The Home Page\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-14 at 8 06 59 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/21213734/83171890-c23a-11e6-9959-1f9548c02d0b.png\">\r\n\r\n###Your Profile\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-14 at 8 08 05 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/21213737/8d51a866-c23a-11e6-94c2-10228879dcf5.png\">\r\n\r\n###Edit Profile\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-14 at 8 05 34 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/21213745/98a7531e-c23a-11e6-9a25-f5fe0c9f5895.png\">\r\n\r\n###Browse\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1438\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-14 at 8 09 21 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/21213751/a4f1d87e-c23a-11e6-9adc-2fc5aeb0e37e.png\">\r\n\r\n###Scheduling a Session\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-12-14 at 8 10 29 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12768461/21213755/afb2c67e-c23a-11e6-88d2-50defba87a59.png\">\r\n\r\n## Developer Guide\r\n* Be sure that Meteor is installed on your development system.\r\n\r\n* git clone the project to a project directory with the command:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/alloyteams/alloy.\r\n\r\n* Install NPM on your development machine\r\n\r\n* To run a local instance of the site on your development system, enter your project directory and run the command:\r\n\r\n    meteor â€”settings ../config/settings.development.json\r\n\r\n* Local instance can be accessed on any modern browser at localhost:3000\r\n\r\n* It may be helpful to refer to [this template](https://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/).\r\n\r\n## Initial User Study\r\nFor this initial user review, we gathered five students that were from the University of Hawaii system and had working UH accounts in order to log in and access the application.\r\n\r\nThe reviews mostly touched upon the user friendliness of the interface and the relative difficulty of understanding the purpose of using such an application. All reviewers recommended that a new banner image for the application be chosen as the current one is still rather bloated and detracts from the overall aesthetics of the application. However, they liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and liked having everything laid out in front of them.\r\n\r\nThe reviewers thought that they liked the concept and intended use of the application and approved of the ability to \"follow\" a user in order to keep track of musicians and make friends. They recommended that the navigation should be placed at the top and that the picture was rather distracting. They also recommended that there be a announcements page that they should land in first to see any updated content. They would also like to see a forum implemented so that others could talk and hang out online. There should also be a specific area dedicated to technical support, which could be implemented into the forum.\r\n\r\n## Current Milestones\r\n[Milestone 1](https://github.com/manoajamsesh/manoajam/projects/1)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 2](https://github.com/manoajamsesh/manoajam/projects/2)\r\n\r\n[Milestone 3](https://github.com/manoajamsesh/manoajam/projects/3)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nAzad Abdeljawad (@Azadaj)\r\n\r\nDee Mosher (@dmosher42)\r\n\r\nKendrick Chen (@kendrickchen)",

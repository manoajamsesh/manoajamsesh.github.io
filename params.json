  "body": "# Welcome to Manoa Jam.\r\n## The Problem\r\nMany UH students have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.\r\n\r\n## Our Solution\r\nThe Campus Jam application allows students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nDee Mosher (@dmosher42)\r\nKendrick Chen (@kendrickchen)\r\nCameron Simao (@cksimao)\r\nAzad Abdeljawad (@Azadaj)\r\nPreston Exzabe (@pexzabe)\r\n\r\n## Mockup Pages\r\n\r\n\r\n",
